This page exists just to say thank you to all the people whose work I've used and people who have supported me in life. 🙇‍

## Thanks to

* [Wei Huang]() for designing [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans), the charming Grotesque font that is the Kimeiga brand's title font
* [Rasmus Andersson](https://twitter.com/rsms) for designing [Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/), the clean, legible screen font that is the Kimeiga brand's body font
* [Mathieu Mayer-Mazzoli](https://github.com/mx3m) for developing the highly unique [Hikari](https://github.com/mx3m/hikari-for-jekyll) Jekyll theme that I expanded upon to create this site.

and my parents, friends, and family for their infinite support.

*Sizi seviyorum* 💛
